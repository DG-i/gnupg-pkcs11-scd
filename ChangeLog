* Added more charachters to serialization exclude chars.
  People may need to re-learn cards.

* Fixed configure GPG_HOME typeo, thanks to Bob Dunlop.

* Unlike gpg-agent, gnupg-pkcs11-scd supports more than one token available
  at the same time. In order to make gpg-agent happy, gnupg-pkcs11-scd always
  returns the same card serial number to gpg-agent.
  When unavailable token is requested, gnupg-pkcs11-scd will use NEEDPIN
  callback in order to ask for the requested token.
  When and if gpg-agent will support more than one serial number or NEEDTOKEN
  callback, this behaviour will be modified.

* Works as single threaded win32 server. Implementing multi-threaded server
  forces copy of win32 socket handling from gnupg, and it is GPLed.
  When libassuan will handle sockets we will be able to implement it.

* Added system wide configuration file, thanks to Bub Dunlop.

* Some more minor fixes.

2006-10-11 -- Version 0.01

* Initial release.
