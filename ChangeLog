2007-01-05 -- Version 0.03

* Fixed some Intel C compiler warnings.

* pkcs11-helper is now external dependency.

* Decrypt support unwrap now, thanks for
  Christoph Neerfeld help.

2006-10-20 -- Version 0.02

* Added more characters to serialization exclude chars.
  People may need to re-learn cards.

* Fixed configure GPG_HOME typeo, thanks to Bob Dunlop.

* Unlike gpg-agent, gnupg-pkcs11-scd supports more than
  one token available at the same time. In order to make
  gpg-agent happy, gnupg-pkcs11-scd always returns the
  same card serial number to gpg-agent.
  When unavailable token is requested, gnupg-pkcs11-scd
  will use NEEDPIN callback in order to ask for the
  requested token.
  When and if gpg-agent will support more than one serial
  number or NEEDTOKEN callback, this behavior will be
  modified.

* Works as single threaded win32 server. Implementing
  multi-threaded server forces copy of win32 socket handling
  from gnupg, and it is GPLed.
  When libassuan will handle sockets we will be able to
  implement it.

* Added system wide configuration file, thanks to Bub Dunlop.

* Some more minor fixes.

2006-10-11 -- Version 0.01

* Initial release.
