????-??-?? -- Version 0.02

* Added more charachters to serialization exclude chars.
  People may need to re-learn cards.

* Fixed configure GPG_HOME typeo, thanks to Bob Dunlop.

* Works as single threaded win32 server. Implementing multi-threaded server
  forces copy of win32 socket handling from gnupg, and it is GPLed.
  When libassuan will handle sockets we will be able to implement it.

2006-10-11 -- Version 0.01

* Initial release.
